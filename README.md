No pushing from your local `master` branch to remote `master` branch.

To create your local branch,
```
git checkout -b branch_name
```

To push your local branch to remote for the first time.
```
git push --set-upstream origin branch_name
```

Once upstream was set, for succeeding push,
```
git push
```

### 2. VS Code Setup
